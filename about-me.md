## Welcome to Franz's GitHub Pages

I am a web developer who offers multiple years of full stack development experience. I can use project management tools to both manage a team and deliver my own projects. I started as a backend programmer, worked as a front end developer, and managed multiple overseas and in-house employees for different companies. I can use different programming languages with proper use of OOP, data structures, and other design patterns. With regards to server and systems management, I am able to use cloud platforms, program Bash, or create proprietary applications connected to private platforms. I can use different databases ranging from SQL to NoSQL. Combining the knowledge I possess, I can create my own framework or use other frameworks. In project management, I am well-versed using Jira Agile, and the use of JQL. I can use network protocols and secure a system architectural design, comfortably use command lines, scale servers and networks, and have a strong passion to document all Iâ€™ve learned in my experience and explain things thoroughly.
